I've just spent the last seven hours attending a workshop about SageMaker, AutoPilot, BERT, Athena, TensorFlow, Spark, [..] and I feeling a bit light-headed.
Of course, the talk and guidance by @AntjeBarth and @ChrisFregly was really well prepared, but if you're just an ML-beginner (like me) and ten thousands of new technologies drop in, you have to work hard to follow the fast paced event.
Of course, I started in the summer 2019 my ML-journey, but it was more focussed on image-processing, not NLP. I worked before with Python, Jupyter notebooks, TensorFlow and Keras, but that whole SageMaker-thing was new to me.
And I see the potential: instead of running the stuff locally, you prepare, prototype and run your ML-app inside Amazon's infrastructure. And that AutoPilot, which helps to quickstart the prototyping by trying several preprocessing-steps and models for you on your data, looks promising. Will definitely give it a second look.

For now I am quite happy to have created that block fo free time.
